Comprehensions take similar to for loop except that it can be expressed into a single line. 

For example, below will iterate the process of summing three variables that takes different integer in a range of 1 and 3. This will produce 27 different cases each of which will be stored in 3x3x3 array. 

```
[ i + j + k for i=1:3, j=1:3, k=1:3 ] 
```

Output: 
```
3×3×3 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 3  4  5
 4  5  6
 5  6  7

[:, :, 2] =
 4  5  6
 5  6  7
 6  7  8

[:, :, 3] =
 5  6  7
 6  7  8
 7  8  9
```
