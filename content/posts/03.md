## Struct

Constructors are a function that creates new objects. It could also be served as a function when applied to an argument tuple. This can be done using `struct` syntax. It is a kind of type in Julia that is specified as a name and a set of fields, that looks something similar to `JSON` representation without specific values assigned. 
```
struct Foo 
    bar
    baz 
end 

# Note that when Foo is served as a constructor function,
# each element of the argument tuple is used as a value for the ordered fields.
foo = Foo("happy","bear")
foo.bar

julia> "happy"

foo.baz

julia> "bear"

# Order matters
foo = Foo("bear","happy?")
foo.bar

julia> "bear"

foo.baz 

julia> "happy?"

```


## For loop 

Making a for loop in Julia is simple. Following codes will iterate over i = 1,2,3,..., 10 and print the number. 
```
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end 
```

## RData

Performing simulations to find a convergence using R could take __forever__. So here I use `RData` package to allow R object to be converted to Julia object. Then use that object as an ingredient to feed into a simulation. Take the following steps:

```
using RData 
import CodeBZip2 

# objs will be Dictionary
objs=load('data/pr_a2.rda')
print(objs)

julia> 
Dict{String, Any} with 1 entry:
  "pr_a2" => 9×7 DataFrame…

# extract the object to store it as a dataframe
pr_a2=objs["pr_a2"]

julia>  
9×7 DataFrame
```

## Filter in DataFrame 

We can filter rows by using `filter(source => f::Function, df)`. See the following example where I'm filtering rows of pr_a2 data frame using var1 and var2 to satisfy two conditions; (1) `var1==s0`,` (2) `var2==g0`. However, I'm denoting each row in respective column var1 and var2 as s and g. Thus the code would look instead as follows:

```
# for each element in the column var1 and var2, 
# where each element for respective column is represented by s and g,
# find rows in pr_a2 that makes s equals s0 and g equals g0
# then return column var3
filter([:var1, :var2]=>
    (s,g)->s==s0 && g==g0, pr_a2)[:var3]
```

## Sample 

Suppose I want to produce 10 random values that is selected from a set ["a", "b"] with probability [0.3, 0.7]. This implies that the probability of drawing "a" is 0.3 and "b" is 0.7. 
```
wsample(["a", "b"], [0.3, 0.7], 10)

julia> 
10-element Vector{String}:
 "b"
 "b"
 "b"
 "b"
 "a"
 "a"
 "b"
 "b"
 "a"
 "b"
```
