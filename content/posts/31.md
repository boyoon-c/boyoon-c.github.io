## Set up 
- An agent decides whether to delay her employment later (keep searching) or take the job (settle).
- An agent's action is binary (keep searching or take the job).
- If she takes the job, she will get constant wage indefinitely.
- If she rejects the job, she receives unemployment compensation c and reconsider her choice next period.
- The probability of observing wage offer is uniformly distributed. 
- There are n states of wages with equal probability.
- The worker's problem is to maximize her expected discounted total sum of earnings. 


## The Value Function 

$$ 
V(w) = \max_{a} [\frac{w}{1-\beta}, c + \beta \sum_{i=1}^n V(w_i)p_i]
$$
