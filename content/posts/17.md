# SymPy.jl

When functions are linear in parameters, we can decompose a matrix of polynomials into a matrix of coefficients and a matrix of variables. To achieve this, we can use the `SymPy` package. 

First we need to ensure that Julia recognizes variables and treats them as symbols. 
```
using SymPy 
x, y = symbols("x, y")
```

Then we can simply invoke the`coeff()` method to extract coefficients from the polynomials. 
```
p = x + 0.5*y + 1 

p.coeff(x)
p.coeff(y)
```
Output:
```
1
0.500000000000000
```

```
