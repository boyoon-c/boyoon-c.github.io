# SymPy.jl

When functions are linear in parameters, we can decompose a matrix of polynomials into a matrix of coefficients and a matrix of variables. To achieve this, we can use the `SymPy` package. 

First we need to ensure that Julia recognizes variables and treats them as symbols. 
```
using SymPy 
x, y = symbols("x, y")
```

Then we can simply invoke the`coeff()` method to extract coefficients from the polynomials. 
```
p = x + 0.5*y + 1 

p.coeff(x)
p.coeff(y)
```
Output:
```
1
0.500000000000000
```

Next, suppose we have matrix of polynomials, \\(P(x;\theta)\\)  denoted by `Pm` below in Julia. Note that each element of `Pm` is linear in the parameters. Thus, we can represent `Pm` as the multiplication of a matrix of coefficients, \\(C(\theta)\\) denoted by `C` in Julia, and a vector of variables \\( \mathbf{x}\\), `[x,y]`. 

$$ 
P(x;\theta) = C(\theta) \cdot \mathbf{x}
$$ 

```
Pm= [2*x+ 3*y; 1*x+5*y]
# number of polynomials, M
M=length(Pm)
# number of variables, L
L=2 
# create C, coefficient matrix
C=zeros(L, M)
for i in 1:M
    C[i, 1]=p[i].coeff(x)
    C[i, 2]=p[i].coeff(y) 
end 
C
```

Output:
```
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  3.0
 1.0  5.0
```

Notice that multiplying `C` by `[x, y]` is equivalent to `Pm`. 
```
C*[x,  y]
``` 

Output:
```
2-element Vector{Sym}:
 2.0⋅x + 3.0⋅y
 1.0⋅x + 5.0⋅y
```
