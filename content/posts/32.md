By using  `Ref()`, it protects the object inside it from being iterated over. Supoose we define the following function `fun`. See the examples below that demonstrate how broadcasting works: 
```
fun(a,x)=a.-x 
```

__Case 1__: 
```
fun.([1,2], [3,4])
```

Note that without `Ref()`, both arguments of function `fun` are interated over from broadcasting. This implies that each element within each argument will be computed element-wise. ([1-3, 2-4])


```
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 -2
 -2
```

__Case 2__:
```
fun.([1,2], Ref([3,4]))
```
Note that `Ref()` protects [3,4]. Therefore only [1,2] are iterated over, not [3,4]. This means that 1 is repeated over 3 and 4, resulting in 1-3, 1-4 respectively. Then 2 is repeated over 3 and 4, resulting in 2-3, 2-4. As a result, the final output will appear as follows:

```
2-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [-2, -3]
 [-1, -2]
```

__Case 3__:
```
fun.(Ref([1,2]), [3,4])
```
This case, only [3,4] are iterated over, not [1,2]. This means that 3 is repeated over 1 and 2, resulting in 1-3, 2-3 respectively. Then 4 is repeated over 1 and 2, resulting in 1-4, 2-4, respectively. As a result, the final output will appear as follows:
```
2-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [-2, -1]
 [-3, -2]
```
