Went to Epik High concert. Can't forget the sound, the vibe, the exhilarating vibration of bass that I felt from the tip of my foot. Then, I thought to myself this is what I like, this is what I love. 

Take some time to enjoy life. Find something you think is worth spending your time and energy on. And do that more often. 

Life may be constant repetition of victory and defeat. But at least choose your own battle, the battle that you enjoy, the battle that brings you happiness even if you get defeated. With some joy sprinkled in, your life is worth living for.
