Some argue that those who fail to utilize AI cannot keep up with their competitors. But is that necessarily true? 

To answer this question, we need to consider how AI affects workforce competition. Suppose that two candidates, one with high-skills (referred to as worker A) and the other with low-skills (referred to as worker B) are competing for a job at some company C. Now that AI is readily available to both workers, they would both use it, assuming that AI improves their competitiveness. However, AI may have a greater impact on the ability of worker B, who has low skills, than on the ability of worker A with higher skills.  

As the hiring manager of company C, the AI-assisted profiles of worker B and worker A may appear equally competitive, or AI may help worker A perform as well as worker B during the hiring process. Then, the question arises, does company C still prefer the high-skilled worker, worker A, over the low-skilled worker, worker B? If AI-assisted versions of worker A and worker B perform equally, then there is less reason for company C to favor the high-skilled worker over the low-skilled worker. It may or may not be true, but it is a possibility.
