The elements in the reshaped matrix will always be orderded column-wise.  For example, consider the following code:
```
using LinearAlgra 
C = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
reshape(C, (2,3))
```

Output:
```
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3  5
 2  4  6
```

Notice that number 2 is placed in the first column of the second row, instead of the second column of the first row. 

Suppose that we want to create a 2-by-3 matrix where the first row is initially filled and the second row is filled afterwards. We can accomplish this by using `permutedims` function. 
```
permutedims(reshape(C, (3,2)), (2,1))
```

What above code does is first reshape matrix `C` into three-by-two matrix. 

```
reshape(C, (3,2))
```

```
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```

Then, `permutedims` alters the matrix's dimensions so that the first dimension of the new matrix corresponds to the second dimension of `reshape(C, (3,2))`, and the second dimension of the new matrix corresponds to the first dimension of `reshape(C, (3,2))`. This effectively takes the column of `reshape(C, (3,2))` and places it as the row of the new matrix.

```
permutedims(reshape(C, (3,2)), (2,1))
```

Output:
```
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
```
