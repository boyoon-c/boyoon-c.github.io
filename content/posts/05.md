To answer this questions, I needed to ask myself which fields are difficult to imagine humans out of the picture. This led me to consider fields that place value on the dynamic nature of imperfections. 

## Sports 

I believe that the primary reason for using artificial intelligence is to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. By default, they strive for perfection by optimizing the value function and finding roots as quickly as possible. Additionally, robots don't have biological limits, unlike humans (Note: I'm not using "robots" and "artificial intelligence" interchangeably, but rather, referring to artificial intelligence placed on non-human objects, which I'll call "robots" hereinafter.) Therefore tournaments that test physical limits may be one of the fields that are hard to replace with artificial intelligence, as they are regarded as features that are inherent only to humans. 

Why do we watch the Olympics, World Cups, and NBA? Because we don't know the end results. We don't know who the winner will be. We love watching the dynamics of how the game evolves. More often than not, we get inspired and get motivated by seeing someone who challenges their physical limits that we thought was impossible to overcome. 

In that sense, it is hard to imagine a game that only robots play. One, robots do not have physical limits, and two, the game might end up having a clear winner, the one with a more effective algorithm. 

One might also argue that a game can be rigged, i.e., the results as well as the evolution of the game programmed in advance with some random elements added to it. If no body knows how the game is programmed or the nature of its random components, it might appear real. However, where is the fun in that? It will never create the drama that you see in World Cup, where you constantly winess miracles; the winning of the underdog that you never imagine happening beforehand.
