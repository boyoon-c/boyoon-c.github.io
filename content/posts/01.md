Economics has been long striving to predict our behaviors. Unlike natural science, social science deals with far more noise. There’s always noise and error somewhere, not only from the technical errors that come from sampling and whatnot but in fact something to do with being human. People are inconsistent and occasionally irrational. That is perhaps why we need such a job as an economist because after all, we would like to predict the future that is created by the aggregate of these unpredictable people to better prepare ourselves for the uncertainties. 

The question is though, what if it’s possible to perfectly predict the future? What does that mean? Imagine a situation where we could perfectly foresee the future when we are given certain conditions and those conditions are known. In fact, the prediction could be done at such a micro level that we could actually predict each individual’s behavior based on their historical data as well as the data that each of them is producing right at this moment. What does that entail? Maybe this is more than just an empty question but in fact, rather involves a much deeper insight into philosophy as well. Now the question should become is that what we really want? 

Free will is one of the factors that define humans. However, artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and all these modern technologies imply our behaviors are somewhat predetermined, that if we are given certain conditions and those conditions are previously known, we could calculate exactly what we are going to be doing next. This would be directly counter to the notion of people’s free will. And even worse, by manipulating those factors that influence our behavior that our behaviors can be controlled with extreme subtlety. 

I’ve only thought that some world described in Matrix, the movie, is just fictional. However, as technology progresses, it seems more like our world becomes something like it.
