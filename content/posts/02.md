## Basics 

In Julia, the name of the variables can be very flexible; we can use Unicode as a variable name. You can also use Unicode math symbols as variable names. To do so, type a backslash followed by the Latex Symbol; then press tab to autocomplete. For example, to type the alpha symbol, simply type "\alpha" followed by tab. 

```{julia}
# Assigning values to different types to variables 
x = 1
안녕하세요 = 2
y = "안녕하세요"

# We can use Unicode math symbols by backslash Latex symbol followed by tab. 
# For example to type alpha symbol, you coud simply do \alpha-tab. 
α = 3
β = 4
```

One can also assign values to different  variables in a single line. 
``` 
γ, δ, σ, ϵ, ε, ξ = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
```

A variable can hold a matrix and vector too.
```
# a is a 5x1 vector
a = [1;2;3;4;5]
# b is a 5x2 matrix
b = [1 2;3 4;5 6;7 8; 9 10]

```

## Functions 
A function is a mapping of a tuple of arguments to a return value. The following code produces a function called `gFunction` that has two arguments, `x` and `y` and returns their sum.  

```
function gFunction(x,y)
    x + y 
end 

gFunction(1,2)
julia > 3 
```

Another way to define a function is to use "assignment form", where we simply express the function in mathematical format. See the example below.

```
fFunction(x, y) = x - y 

fFunction(5,2) 
julia> 3
```

One exciting feature of Julia is its argument passing behavior. See the example below excerpted from Julia documentation. 
```
fib(n::Integer) = n ≤ 2 ? one(n) : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Let's decompose the above codes into smaller components. Below we define a function called `fib`. This function takes one argument `n` that is declared to be Integer. 
```
fib(n::integer)
```
The above example uses a "ternary operator", an operator for conditional expressions that takes following form in Julia, `___ ? ___ : ___`.  
Notice that `?` acts as a conditional evaluation. If the condition is met, the function will return component before `:`, i.e. `one(n)`, otherwise, it will return the component after `:`, i.e., `fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`. 
```
fib(n::Integer) = n ≤ 2 ? one(n) : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Notice that this function is recursive. Even if we invoke, for example, `fib(5)`, it will recursively run the function until `fib(2)` when it can actually return the numeric value. 

### Some useful operators with special names 

To horizontally concatenate, use `hcat`. 
```
hcat(a,b)
julia>  
 1  1   2
 2  3   4
 3  5   6
 4  7   8
 5  9  10
```
To vertically concatenate, use `vcat`. 

```
c=[6;7;8;9;10]
vcat(a,c)
julia>
10-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10

```
### Method vs. Function 

>  Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. 
>
> The choice of which method to execute when a function is applied is called dispatch. Julia allows the dispatch process to choose which of a function's methods to call based on the number of arguments given, and on the types of all of the function's arguments. This is different than traditional object-oriented languages, where dispatch occurs based only on the first argument, which often has a special argument syntax, and is sometimes implied rather than explicitly written as an argument. Using all of a function's arguments to choose which method should be invoked, rather than just the first, is known as multiple dispatch.

### Anonymous function 

Anonymous function is a function without a name. You can create one using either of the following syntax: 
```
x -> x+ 3
function (x) 
    x+3
end 
```

`map` is often used for executing anonymous function. 

```
map(1:10) do x 
    2x 
end 
map(x->2x, 1:10)

map(1:10, 11:20) do x, y
    x + y
end

map((x,y)->x+y, 1:10, 11:20)
```
## Plots 

To create plots, one can use the `Plots` or `Gadfly` package.
```
using Plots 

x=range(0,10, length=100)
plot(x, x->x^2)
```
