## for loop  `in`, `∈`, `=` 

Below three for loops return the same output. Note that `in`, `∈`, `=` can be used interchangeably to indicate that `i` loops over the following array, `1:2:10` which indicates that the array ranges from 1 to 10 with an increment of 2. 


```
for i in 1:2:10
    println(i)
end

for i ∈ 1:2:10
    println(i)
end 

for i = 1:2:10
    println(i)
end 
```
Output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### `eachindex`
I also introduce in this post `eachindex`, which returns the index of a given vector. Note that  the array `1:2:10` has five elements, and `i` will loop over the five indices with `eachindex(1:2:10)` .
```
for i = eachindex(1:2:10)
    println(i)
end 
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
