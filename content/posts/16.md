## Selecting and transforming columns

When selecting variables of a data frame, we do add `:` to indicate that it's a variable name. Thus for example, if we want to select column with variable `x`, we use `:x` inside `select()`. 

First let's construct some 500 by 3 dimensional data frame called `df` that contains three columns each of which has name of `A`, `B`, and `C`.

```
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(
    A=1:2:1000, 
    B= repeat(1:10, inner=50), 
    C= 1:500)
```

Each of below codes produces 500 by 1 dataframe, a data frame that only contains column `A`.  
```
select(df, :A)
df[:, [:A]]
```

For example, see the first 10 rows of `select(df, :A)`.  

```
select(df, :A) |> (x->first(x, 10))
```

Output: 
```
10×1 DataFrame
 Row │ A     
     │ Int64 
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
   2 │     3
   3 │     5
   4 │     7
   5 │     9
   6 │    11
   7 │    13
   8 │    15
   9 │    17
  10 │    19
```

## Rename 

Below codes allow us to rename the exisitng columns, from `A` and `B` to `a` and `b`. Note that we use broadcasting `.=>` to make this code work. 

```
select(df, [:A, :B].=>[:a, :b])
```


## Create a new column 

Below we create a new column called `C`that adds two columns, `A` and `B`, element-wise. 
```
select(df, :, [:A, :B]=>((a, b)->a.+b)=>:C)
```

## Pipe operator

Pipe operator `|>` is in Julia Base package. I was pleasantly surprised that Julia has similar operator to pipe operator, `%>%`, in R. 

The pipe operator is a helpful tool for nesting multiple functions within one another but in a concise and legible way. 

For example suppose we want to raise a vector `vec` to the power of 3 and then sum the results. There are several ways to achieve this, but we can conveniently use the pipe operator to accomplish the task, regardless of which way we choose. 

```
vec=[1,2,3,4,5]
vec .^3 |> sum
[vec[i]^3 for i in 1:5] |>sum
vec |> x->x.^3|>x->sum(x)
```
