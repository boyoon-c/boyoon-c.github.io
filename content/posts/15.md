## Taking a Subset 

We can subset a dataframe using index. For example we can subset specific columns and rows by following codes. 

```
# column subset (subset df to only include column A and C)
df[:, [:A, :C]]

# row subset (subset df to only include 1st, 3rd, and 5th rows)
df[[1,3,5], :]
```

We could also use some selectors such as `Not`, `Between`, `Cols`and `All`.  Following code removes columns whose names match `r"x"`.

```
# add two columns x1 and x2 to df 
df[:, :x1].=0
df[:, :x2].=1

# subset columns whose names match "x"
df[:, r"x"]

# subset columns whose names do not match "x"
df[:, Not(r"x")]

# subset columns that are not A
df[:, Not(:A)][1:10, :]
```

## Subsetting functions 

We could use `subset` function to subset a dataframe. 

```
# subset df where it looks at column A 
# to screen through observations whose values are less than 10
subset(df, :A=>a-> a .<10)
```
