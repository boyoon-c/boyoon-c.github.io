## How to check the number of threads 
```
Threads.nthreads()
```

Output:
```
8
```
For me, I have eight threads at my disposal for code execution. 


## How to check thread id
```
Threads.threadid()
```
Output:
```
1
```
Since we are on the master thread, `Threads.threadid()` will return 1.


## `@threads` Macro

Below we create `a` with 10 elements in it, then use multi-threads to put thread id used to process the given for loop. To use multi-thread, we use `Threads.@threads` in front of a for loop to indicate the region that follows are multi-threaded region. 

```
a = zeros(10)
Threads.@threads for i = 1:10
           a[i] = Threads.threadid()
       end
```

Output:
```
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 1.0
 2.0
 2.0
 3.0
 4.0
 5.0
 6.0
 7.0
 8.0
```
