## `push!` 

Continuing on previous post, let's start with creating an `Dictionary` object. 
```
eng2kor=Dict(
    "one"=>"일",
    "two"=>"이",
    "three"=>"삼",
    "four"=>"사"    
)
```

Output:
```
Dict{String, String} with 4 entries:
  "two"   => "이"
  "four"  => "사"
  "one"   => "일"
  "three" => "삼"
```

`push!` allows us to add one additional key-value pair if the added key is not present in the existing Dictionary, or if it is present, replace existing key with different value. 

```
# replace with existing key with different value
push!(eng2kor, "four"=>"😃")
```

Output:
```
Dict{String, String} with 4 entries:
  "two"   => "이"
  "four"  => "😃"
  "one"   => "일"
  "three" => "삼"
```

```
# add new key-value pair 
push!(eng2kor, "five"=>"다섯")
```

Output:
```
Dict{String, String} with 5 entries:
  "two"   => "이"
  "four"  => "😃"
  "one"   => "일"
  "three" => "삼"
  "five"  => "다섯"
```

Contrary to unordered `Dictionary`, `Array` is an ordered mutable list, which implies that when `push!` is applied to an `Array`, it will add elements to the end of the array. 


`push!` applied to an `Array` would 

```
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
push!(a, 6,7)
```

Output:
```
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
```

## `pop!`

`pop!` will remove the specified key with its associated value, when applied to `Dictionary` object. 
```
pop!(eng2kor, "one")
```

Output:
```
Dict{String, String} with 4 entries:
  "two"   => "이"
  "four"  => "😃"
  "three" => "삼"
  "five"  => "다섯"
```

If applied to an `Array`, it will remove the last element of the array. 
```
pop!(a)
```

Output:
```
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
