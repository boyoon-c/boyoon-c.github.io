      <description>Consider a simple consumption-saving model, where action (a) is defined by the amount of savings each period, state (s) defined by the current stock, reward be the utility which depends on consumption (c=s-a). Suppose that state is updated where the output is drawn from a uniform distribution on {0, . . . , B}. Let the global upper bound of storage be M.
State space State space is \(n = M+B+1\) dimension.</description>

      <description>Taking a Subset We can subset a dataframe using index. For example we can subset specific columns and rows by following codes.
# column subset (subset df to only include column A and C) df[:, [:A, :C]] # row subset (subset df to only include 1st, 3rd, and 5th rows) df[[1,3,5], :] We could also use some selectors such as Not, Between, Colsand All. Following code removes columns whose names match r&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Create dataframe To create a dataframe, simply use DataFrame function after loding DataFrames.jl.
Following code produces a dataframe composed of three variables, A, B, and C, each of which has 500 rows. Each row of column A increments by 2 starting from integer 1. Column B repeats 50 times of each integer starting from 1. Coumn C lists integers from 1 to 500.
using DataFrames df = DataFrame(A=1:2:1000, B= repeat(1:10, inner=50), C= 1:500) first, last The first and last functions act as head and tail function in R, which allow us to view the first or the last couple of rows of the dataset.</description>

      <description>Let \(s_t\) denotes the state variable, \(a_t\) denotes the action, \(\beta\) denotes a discount factor. Note that \(r(a_t, s_t)\) can be interpreted as a current reward that is a function of the current action and current state.</description>

      <description>Rewards The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative sum of the rewards of the long-run. The rewards could be arbitrarily chosen number that summarizes how one wants the agent to behave under specific state, action, and subsequent state.
The rewards function, formally represented by \(R(s)\) or \(R(s,a)\), or \(R(s, a, s^\prime)\) can depend on current state, the subsequent state as well as the action taken by the agent taken in the current state.</description>

      <description>The agent and the environment In finite Markov Decision Process (MDP), we have three sets, a set of states, a set of actions, and a set of rewards.
The learner or decision maker is called agent and the outside system that the agent interacts with is called environment. Everyperiod, the agent takes actions and correspondingly the environment reacts to produce new states to the agent.
Each period, the environment presents \(S_t\) from a set \( S\).</description>

      <description>Map map(f, c...) applies function f to each element of collection c that enter as the the second argument of the map function.
Below two lines of codes produce same output. This means that map also acts as a for loop.
map(x-&amp;gt;x+2, 1:10) [ x + 2 for x=1:10] Output:
10-element Vector{Int64}: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The function that enters the first argument of map could take multiple arguments; it could be more than one argument.</description>

      <description>Comprehensions works similar to for loop except that it can be expressed into a single line.
For example, below will iterate the process of summing three variables that takes different integer in a range of 1 and 3. This will produce 27 different cases each of which will be stored in 3x3x3 array.
[ i + j + k for i=1:3, j=1:3, k=1:3 ] Output:
3×3×3 Array{Int64, 3}: [:, :, 1] = 3 4 5 4 5 6 5 6 7 [:, :, 2] = 4 5 6 5 6 7 6 7 8 [:, :, 3] = 5 6 7 6 7 8 7 8 9 </description>
